# Technical Aspects
The test file has been generated with 
KMyMoney V. 5.2.1.

When you change the test.xml file, please save it in *uncompressed* XML format 
(by convention, compressed 
KMyMoney
files have the extension 
"kmy").

# Testing Aspects
Please be careful when making changes on the file: All JUnit test cases heavily rely on it, and you might break things.
